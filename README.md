Performed analysis on Louise Kickstarter data


# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis

## Project Overview and Purpose

o	Our client Louise recently ran a fundraising play called Fever.  This play did very well and came close to reaching it’s goal.  This Project will show Louise how similar fundraisers fared over the past 9 years.

## Project Analysis and Challenges

o	The campaign data was broken down in two ways.  The first was All Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date and the second Play Outcomes Based on Goals.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

o	The goal of this analysis is to show the result of ALL Theater campaigns that took place based on what month the project was started.  The data will compare successful, failed and canceled outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

o	This part of the analysis focuses on only data for the Play subcategory.  This will compare the successful, failed and canceled outcomes in relation to how much their fundraising goal was and what percentage of the total outcomes they represent.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

o	There were active or “Live” campaigns included in the dataset.  As these were not completed and results were pending, they had to be filtered out so they did not skew the results in any way.  


## Results

o	Conclusions from Outcomes Based on Launch Date
o	Based on the analysis I conclude that the amount of cancelations were consistently low in every month with one outlier in October that did not have any.
o	The data also showed that May and June not only had the highest number of campaigns but had the highest success rate of any other months as well as compared to the total success rate.
o	December was also the only month that had less than a 50% success rate and had almost equal amount of failures.

o	Conclusions from Outcomes Based on Goals
o	The results of this analysis showed that campaigns with a goal between $25,000 and $35,000 were most likely to fail with rates much higher than any other goal range.

o	Limitations of the Dataset and recommendations
o	The data is limited to filtering the results by the country in took place in.  I would recommend adding columns to filter by city or theater location. A graph could then be added to show the success/failure rate in a specific place.  
o	In addition, I would recommend using a Bar chart to show how play outcomes compare to the other theater subcategories.
